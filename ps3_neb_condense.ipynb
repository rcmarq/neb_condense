    "## Condensation of the first solids in the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will try to predict what the first solids to condense in the Solar System will be. This is based on the work by <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(72)90078-6'>Grossman (1972)</a>. As you may recall, this work has revolutionized the field of cosmochemistry as it has been one of the first works to successfully match the mineralogy of refractory inclusions in meteorites, which were later recognized as the first condensates in the Solar System. While not the first work to work on equilibrium condensation from the nebular gas, it was the first to implement a scheme where the calculation parameters were reconfigured whenever the condensation of a new mineral phases starts. Here, we will deal with a very simplified version of these calculations"

    "So far, we have only dealt with gaseous species in the nebula. But, as you may gues, the condensation of minerals results to significant changes in the relative abundances of the remaining gaseous species. This is at the core of what made the calculations by <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(72)90078-6'>Grossman (1972)</a> so successful in predicting the first solids to condense from the nebula - once the system reaches a point where a mineral starts condensing, he modified the equations to match this such that the trajectory of the gases' partial pressures changes. \n",

    "Here, we examine the condensation of the first mineral in the Solar System, **Corundum** ($Al_2O_3$ - aka Sapphire, Ruby). \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color ='A40802'> First, we need to make use of our newly-acquired skill of calculating molar densities and partial pressures at a given temperature. We can essentially take the code from above and re-write it as a function, which we can then iterate through a loop for different temperatures. Once you have a working function and loop to do this, you should be able to replicate the figure in question (iv) of the problem set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the condensation of corundum ($Al_2O_3$) should be relatively straight-forward. First, note that corundum forms through the following reaction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$2Al_{(g)} + 3O_{(g)} = Al_2O_{3(c)}$$ <br>\n",
    "And so, when modifying the system of equations (at function `sysofeq`), some sort of relationship (see $K_{eq}$) that takes this into account should appear as one of the additional equations. This comes in handy, as we are solving for an extra variable (`nAl2O3` in this case - so 7 variables for 7 equations).  Take note however that this relationship only needs to be satisfied <b>IF and WHEN corundum is condensing</b>. \n",
    "    \n",
    "This necessitates some sort of criteria for us to know whether corundum is condensing or not, and have this be incoporated in the loop such that we switch from (1) an equation where Al and O adhere to the equilibrium constraints, to (2) an equation where `nAl2O3` is simply 0.  \n",
