    "## Condensation of the first solids in the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will try to predict what the first solids to condense in the Solar System will be. This is based on the work by <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(72)90078-6'>Grossman (1972)</a>. As you may recall, this work has revolutionized the field of cosmochemistry as it has been one of the first works to successfully match the mineralogy of refractory inclusions in meteorites, which were later recognized as the first condensates in the Solar System. While not the first to work on equilibrium condensation from the nebular gas, it was the first to implement a scheme where the calculation parameters were reconfigured whenever the condensation of new mineral phases starts. Here, we will deal with a very simplified version of these calculations\n",

    "<i> Sections 1 to 4 are mainly for reading/instruction for you to understand how the calculation works. The main code that you're gonna be running is at Section 5. However, the data import and interpolation functions at section 3 need to be run so you can use the `calcNP` function in Section 5 </i>"

    "So far, we have only dealt with gaseous species in the nebula. But, as you may have guessed, the condensation of minerals results to significant changes in the relative abundances of the remaining gaseous species. This is at the core of what made the calculations by <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(72)90078-6'>Grossman (1972)</a> so successful in predicting the first solids to condense from the nebula - once the system reaches a point where a mineral starts condensing, he modified the equations to match this such that the trajectory of the gases' partial pressures changes. \n",

    "Here, we examine the condensation of the first mineral in the Solar System, **corundum** ($Al_2O_3$ - aka Sapphire, Ruby). \n",

    "First, we need to make use of our newly-acquired skill of calculating molar densities and partial pressures at a given temperature. We can essentially take the code from above and re-write it as a function, which we can then iterate through a loop for different temperatures. Once you have a working function and loop to do this, you should be able to replicate the figure in question (i) of the problem set. <br>\n",
